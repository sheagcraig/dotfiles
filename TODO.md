# Ansible Version
- Ansible Galaxy cert is not verifiable out of the box. (had to -c ignore)
- Brew fails the first time; a brew doctor or brew list seems to resolve magically. Then run again.
- Homebrew choked on a man folder not being owned properly
- Dock kill didn't happen.
- Auto-arrange desktop.
- Break out linux stuff into separate playbook or avoid redundent distro== testing.
- Add interactive prompt for whether you want to git submodule update --remote too
- Audit submodules
- Ansible Galaxy doesn't verify SSL (expecting OpenSSL it seems like)
- Quick bootstrap script to:
	- Should be interactive since I won't need all of these all the time.
	- install python3 from python.org
	- install ansible
	- Commandline tools are installed after they are required for the bootstrap
- Show date in time menu bar.
- Add notification to prompt dark theme enablement until I can make it work.

# Outstanding issues
- Dark theme setting doesn't activate.
