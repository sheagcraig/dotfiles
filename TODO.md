# Ansible Version
- luggage stuff needs become, but my role cannot yet account for that.
- Homebrew installation ends up being done as root, which brew then complains about when you try to actually brew anything.
	- Turns out brew doesn't support 10.13 yet; I have the role that is updated to work though. Hmmm.
- First git init prompts to accept github cert.
- My github key had wrong permissions. I've fixed it, but the dotfiles role doesn't check and fix. Also, it did it wrong initially (private had 600, got 644)
- Set up so that it can be run locally or as a push
- Break out linux stuff into separate playbook?
- Add interactive prompt for whether you want to git submodule update --remote too
- lint and clean
- Audit submodules
- Add bootstrapping code
	- Install python3 from python.org
	- install certifi and link
	- Setup venv and activate.
