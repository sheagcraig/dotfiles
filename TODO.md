- link function can handle ALL; add implicit/defaults for mode, link vs. copy
- Does this really need to run as root? De-rootify in a branch and see if that is better.
	- As far as I can tell, the only things that need root here are:
		- Linux yum installs
		- Either way, start another python process with sudo and block or make a separate script or something.
- Add interactive prompt for whether you watn to git submodule update --remote too
- lint and clean
- Audit submodules
- Add bootstrapping code
	- Install python3 from python.org
	- install certifi and link
	- Setup venv and activate.
