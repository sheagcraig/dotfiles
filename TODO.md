# TODO
- Automatically install ipdb for brewed python.
- git submodule init refuses to work from Salt; works just fine from me doing
  it. Move to power extreme if it's going to elude my grasp much longer.
- Zwift cask install triggers the app to actually run (it downloads the assets
  and whatnot) in a user session, and homebrew moves on and assumes it failed.
  (Commented out for now)
- pkg.latest doesn't work (homebrew). So I do a brew upgrade + brew cask
  upgrade after a pkg.installed.
	- This runs every time though; I think you can do an `onlyif`, and call
	  `brew outdated` to see if there are any updates. But I have to wait for
	  some new ones to become available to confirm.
- iTerm stuff needs to require homebrew, but it's commented out
- fonts didn't install (see below)

- pypirc is not in the dotfiles any more?
- remove slack from homebrew (managed by work)
- since gpg was already installed, it was logged as a homebrew error (see brew PR)
- possibly think about removing update/upgrade from brew stuff since I don't really need to manage this stuff after the initial setup
- Need to run vim to kick off vim-plug download.
