High honour is due him! Take us to those fit to parley with us. There
are words to be spoken, for soon there will be snow in warmyear and
winds blowing backward and trees growing upside down!" The way the
Angyar talked was a real pleasure, Rocannon thought, though its tact
was not what struck you.
  The Claymen stood about in dubious suprise. "Truly this is so?" they
or one or two of them asked at last.
  "Yes, and the sea will turn to wood and stones will grow toes! Take us

between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place, and in the sky,

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders Fields
Take up our quarrel with the foe, 
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch.  Be yours to hold if high,
If ye break faith with us who die,
we shall not sleep, though poppies grow

Apple's going out of business any minute now. At least, that's what
you'd think after listening to the latest round of doomsayers regarding
Apple's future. This pessimism is nothing new. When I give talks about
the industry, I like to point out that people were predicting the
imminent demise of Apple Computer when it was a $100 million company.
Then it was destined to fail at $500 million. At $1 billion, it was too
big to survive. The company was unmanageable at $2 billion and going
down the tubes. It was the end of the line at $4 billion. It was in
terrible shape at $5 billion. Now as the company heads toward $10
billion, it's doomed for sure. I get to say this year after year; all I
have to change is the last number.

thy typing fingers rested.
12. Thou shalt make thy subdirectories with the same capitalization as
thy package identifiers, for the God of Unix is an pedantic God, and

17. Thou shalt stick to the style guidelines, even though it maketh thy
fingers ache and thy brain hurt, yea, even though it commandeth not the
One True Indentation Style, lest thy brethren read thy code without
understanding and curse thee.

A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis
of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite
series of incomprehensible answers calculated with micrometric
precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from
inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical
accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality
for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly
defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the
information in the first place.

was asked of them all; "How much is two plus two?".

an answer exists and is rational".

The computer expert sat down to his console and came up with "1*4 E0".

The philosopher said "What do you _mean_ 'two plus two?'".

The psychologist said "Why do you want to know?".

After the deluge, when dry land had once more appeared, and the ark
had landed.  Noah opened the door ark released all the animals from
the ark.  The animals were of course charged to multiply and replenish
the face of the earth.  All was going well except that the dry land was
yet somewhat limited, and a pair of snakes (adders) were having a hard
time of it.  With all the hoofed animals, they were in constant fear
of being stepped on while they tried to mate.  Noah saw their problem,
and being a kind man he constructed a small low table of logs for them
to hide under where they were finally successful in mating.  Which only
proves that even adders can multiply if they have a log table.

Cities are simple things.  They are conglomerations of people.  Cities
are complex things.  They are geographical and emotional distillations
of whole nations.  What makes a place a city has little to do with size.
It has to do with the speed at which its citizens walk, the cut of their
clothes, the sounds of their shouts.

But most of all, cities are the meeting places of stories.  The men and
women there are narratives, endlessly complex and intriguing.  The most
humdrum of them constitutes a narrative that would defeat Tolstoy at his
best and most voluminous.  The merest hour of the merest day of the
merest of Belfast's citizens would be impossible to render in all its
grandeur and all its beauty.  In cities the stories are jumbled and
jangled.  The narratives meet.  They clash, they converge or convert.
They are a Babel of prose.
