A

The first letter in every properly constructed alphabet. It is the first
natural utterance of the human vocal organs, and is variously sounded,
according to the pleasure and convenience of the speaker. In logic, A
asserts and B denies. Assertions being proverbially untrue, the presumption
would be in favour of B's innocence were it not that denials are notoriously
false. In grammar, A is called the indefinite article, probably because,
denoting a definite number, it is so obviously a numeral adjective.
